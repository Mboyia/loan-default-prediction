🏦 Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. By analyzing customer demographics, financial history, and loan details, the model enables data-driven decision-making for risk assessment and loan approvals.

📌 Project Highlights
Goal: Predict whether a customer will default on a loan (binary classification)

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, imbalanced-learn

Model: Logistic Regression (with future support for Random Forest, XGBoost)

Target Audience: Financial institutions, lenders, credit analysts

📊 Dataset Features (Examples)
Age

Loan amount

Monthly income

Loan term

Repayment history score

Past defaults

Marital status, education level, loan purpose

💡 Business Use Case
This model helps lenders:

Reduce loan default risk

Make smarter approval decisions

Customize loan products based on customer risk

Monitor portfolio risk at scale

🚀 Deliverables
A trained machine learning model (loan_default_model.pkl)

A feature-engineered dataset

An interactive risk scoring tool (Jupyter-based UI)

Model performance metrics (confusion matrix, precision-recall, etc.)

Code ready for deployment or integration

📈 Results Snapshot
Accuracy: ~90%

High recall for non-defaulters

Further tuning ongoing for imbalanced class performance (via SMOTE and class weights)
